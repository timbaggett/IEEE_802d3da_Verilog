For an example simulation using Icarus Verilog , unzip the archive go to the .\IEEE 802d3da_Verilog\IEEE_P802d3da\D2p2\testbench directory, and execute the IEEE_P802_3da_PLCA_simulate.bat file. Click on the demo_040425.gtkw to view the resultant waveform with GTKWave . This example simulation is a 16-node network including MACs (Clause 4), PLS Sublayer (Clause 6), 10BASE-T1S PHY (Clause 147) and IEEE P802.3da PLCA Reconciliation Sublayer (Clause 148).
